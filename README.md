##Introduction
Our team radian roam ranger (RRR), we have chosen a problem statement that requires you to create a platform that connects travellers with genuine local experiences and services, fosters cultural exchange, and supports tour guides to improve the overall tourism ecosystem. To solve this problem, you have developed tourVenture, a web 
progressive app that offers the following main features. 
First, it enables travellers to book their local tour guide. For example, if you want to go to Varanasi and explore the local culture, a local  person from that area will have a better knowledge of
the culture there. 
Second, it provides live cultural event suggestions. For example, if you want to plan a tour on any date, our system will recommend you the cultural events happening on that day. 
Third, it has a personalised tour recommendation system. It suggests you the city names based on your last three previous tours.
